# Added:

## - Permissions (Creative, Survival)
Both classes are separated from each other and have different tags in different colors.

Reduced the amount of code and now everything is in one file instead of two.
Update permission file.
Bugs fix.

## - Entity
Added ability to spawn entity: Zombie and Skeleton. Both classes have buffs relative to vanilla.

## - World
I don't like night maps so I made it always day.

Changed the vanilla way of sending messages to the chat:
<Nickname: Message>  (Looks terrible)

On the:

[Permission Tag] Nickname: Message

## - ScoreBoard

Now you do not need to update the table every time to get updated data, now everything happens automatically and is updated every tick (1 second divided by 20).

Updated statistics show the number of blocks destroyed (all types)

Amount of damage dealt to creatures

Number of monsters killed

Number of player deaths

Time played on the server (in minutes or hours)

Player Level

Ping of the player (I could not check, because I play through the localhost)
