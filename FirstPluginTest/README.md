# Added:

## - Permissions (Creative, Survival)
Both classes are separated from each other and have different tags in different colors.

Reduced the amount of code and now everything is in one file instead of two.
Update permission file.
Bugs fix.

## - Entity
Added ability to spawn entity: Zombie and Skeleton. Both classes have buffs relative to vanilla.

## - World
I don't like night maps so I made it always day.

Changed the vanilla way of sending messages to the chat:
<Nickname: Message>  (Looks terrible)

On the:

[Permission Tag] Nickname: Message

## - Commands

When entering a command in the chat /sb, a table is displayed on the right, which already has:

Player name
Player Biome
Number of players online

Fixed a bug with fuzzy weather setting
